                            Turing proposed the famous Turing test, which is a standard for measuring whether a computer has intelligence.
                            The test involves a person determining whether they are conversing with a human or a computer
                            based on the conversation.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">"The Future About AI"</h3>
        <p id="future">The future of artificial intelligence is highly promising,
            with the potential to revolutionize various industries, including healthcare,
            education, environment, robotics, and entertainment. AI has the potential to
            enable more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatments, sustainable practices,
            intelligent robots and automation systems, and advanced virtual and augmented reality
            experiences. While the future of AI looks bright, we must also consider the ethical and
            societal implications of these developments and use AI in responsible and beneficial ways. Ov
            erall, we can expect to see continued progress in the development of more advanced AI technologies
            that will positively impact our lives in many ways.</p>
