            A new technology allows BCI devices to integrate with AI, allowing users to "think" commands rather than physically issuing them. However, this brings up privacy and ethical concerns as the AI can "learn" from a user's thought patterns.

        <div id="contentCostVsAccessibility" style="display:none;">
